1. Self-Assessment on Current Role: I have assessed my current capabilities and responsibilities within the CCR team, identifying areas where I am operationally strong, such as MSTR administration and CCR perimeter management. This self-assessment has also helped pinpoint areas where further development would enhance my contribution.


2. Knowledge Enhancement Plan: I am actively working on gaining a deeper understanding of CCR processes and have been focusing on acquiring skills in change management, root cause analysis, and the CCR technology stack, including tools like MSTR, Unix, Jenkins, and Python. I aim to complete relevant certifications to solidify this knowledge.

4. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: I am engaged in collaborative efforts with key stakeholders, particularly in aligning CCR tasks across regions. My goal is to facilitate cross-functional teamwork and empower team members with the knowledge and tools they need for autonomous task management.


5. DevOps and Cloud Upskilling: I have started learning DevOps tools such as CI/CD pipelines and exploring cloud technologies relevant to our project needs. This upskilling will enhance my ability to support CCR operations more efficiently and align with the teamâ€™s evolving technical requirements.
